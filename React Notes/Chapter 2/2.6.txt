Properties are like "variables attached to classes/objects

ES6 requires constructor() function, but with next generation javascript

e.g.

constructor(){
    this.myProperty = 'value;
}
becomes :

myProperty = 'value'

----------------
Methods are like "functions attached to classes/objects

myMethod(){
    ...
}

becomes:

myMethod = () => {...}
