-React does not use multiple pages,it just changes what appears on
the user's screen. 

-React can control the entire frontend of a web application ("SPA" approach), 
or single-page-application.
- Server only sends one HTML page which React takes over and control the UI.

-React can also use the "Widget" approach on a multi-page-application. In this 
case, pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server.
-React can therefore control parts of HTML pages or entire pages
