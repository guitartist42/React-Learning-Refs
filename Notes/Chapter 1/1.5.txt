React Alternatives:

-React leans and focuses as a component-based UI library. Ceartain features like
routing are added via community packages.
-Angular is a complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses 
typescript. Can be overkill for smaller projects...
-Vue is a complete component based UI. Inludes most core feature but is less popular
than React and Angular.
